# TOTSimple
A simple always on the top clock programmed in broken java code and a hefty dose of RAGE. It works, eats about 70-80 MB Ram. I am only providing the source because people should rightfully inspect where their software come from and what it contains. Vegans not welcome.

Browse to the V1.0 Branch for the source and JAR file. Master is empty because it has been to many years since I last used GIT and netbeans is a bitch.
