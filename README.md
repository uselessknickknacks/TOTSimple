# TOTSimple
A simple always on the top clock programmed in broken java code and a hefty dose of RAGE. It works, eats about 70-80 MB Ram. I am only providing the source because people should rightfully inspect where their software come from and what it contains. Vegans not welcome.
It's not really that complicated of a program at all and the buttons are self-explanatory. So a README
is not really neccesary.

The only thing you need to be aware off is that timezone textbox input is not sanitized. If you enter 
something other than what is expected the timer responsible for updating the clock label will get fried
and you will need to restart the program.

That is on TODO btw.
