# TOTSimple

Stands for Time On Top Simple. It's a clock that is always ontop of your screen.

A simple always on the top clock programmed in broken java code and a hefty dose of RAGE. It works, eats about 70-80 MB Ram. I am only providing the source because people should rightfully inspect where their software come from and what it contains. Vegans not welcome.
It's not really that complicated of a program at all and the buttons are self-explanatory. So a README
is not really neccesary. 

Timezones:

NEW: Timezone sanitization has been fixed, this means being a clutz and entering a incorrect TimeZone will no longer fry the Clock, it will keep on running as usual (it's a really lazy fix but I.D.G.A.F!). It's better than having to restart the software.


The software is on Europe/Stockholm by default. The program will not remember anything (aka no config file, that's for later when I feel like it). 

Go to this webpage: https://www.mkyong.com/java/java-display-list-of-timezone-with-gmt/
Copy&paste the Continent/Region. For example 
"America/Vancouver" (without "") into the white little textfield next to the "Change TimeZone" button. 
Ensure that no spaces are present at all.
And then press it. If for some reason your city/town whatever is not on that webpage. Pick the next best thing that matches your time.
Give it a sec or two and presto timezone changed.
Ensure that no spaces are present at all.

You will need to redo this each time the software is closed as the software is hardcoded to "Europe/Stockholm".
